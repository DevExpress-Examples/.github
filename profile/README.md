Each example project is a separate repository within the DevExpress Examples organization account. You can do the following to find an example:

* Search for a repository name. Type your query in the `Find a repository...` search box below.
* Perform an advanced search (code, repository description, README content). Type your query in the `Type / to search` search box above, and choose `Search in this organization`. See the following page for details: [About searching on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github).
* Use the DevExpress website instead of GitHub. All of our examples are also available in our [Support Center](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/list?preset=examples) with the option to search and filter by platforms and products.

To run an example, you need a [trial or registered DevExpress product installation](https://www.devexpress.com/Products/Try/).
